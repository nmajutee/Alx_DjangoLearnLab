# Task 2: Follow System and Feed - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Deliverables

### 1. Updated User Model

**File:** `accounts/models.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Model already had `followers` field (ManyToManyField to self)
- `symmetrical=False` ensures one-way following
- `related_name='following'` allows accessing who a user follows
- No new migrations needed (field already existed)

**How it works:**
```python
# Get who alice follows
alice.following.all()

# Get alice's followers
alice.followers.all()

# Add a follower
alice.following.add(bob)

# Remove a follower
alice.following.remove(bob)
```

### 2. Follow Management Views

**File:** `accounts/views.py`

**Created:**

**FollowUserView:**
- POST endpoint to follow a user
- Requires authentication
- Prevents self-following
- Uses `generics.GenericAPIView`
- Returns success message

**UnfollowUserView:**
- POST endpoint to unfollow a user
- Requires authentication
- Removes user from following list
- Returns success message

**Key Features:**
- Uses `get_object_or_404()` for safe user lookup
- Proper permission checks (IsAuthenticated)
- Clear error messages for edge cases
- Simple beginner-friendly implementation

### 3. Feed Functionality

**File:** `posts/views.py`

**Created:**

**FeedView:**
- GET endpoint to retrieve personalized feed
- Requires authentication
- Uses `generics.ListAPIView`
- Filters posts from followed users only
- Orders by newest first (`-created_at`)
- Paginated (10 posts per page)

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    following_users = self.request.user.following.all()
    return Post.objects.filter(author__in=following_users).order_by('-created_at')
```

### 4. URL Configurations

**File:** `accounts/urls.py`

**Added Routes:**
- `POST /api/follow/<int:user_id>/` - Follow user
- `POST /api/unfollow/<int:user_id>/` - Unfollow user

**File:** `posts/urls.py`

**Added Routes:**
- `GET /api/feed/` - Get personalized feed

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Follow System:
- Follow users by ID
- Unfollow users
- Prevent self-following
- One-way following (not mutual)
- Authentication required
- Proper error handling

### ✅ Feed:
- Personalized feed based on following
- Shows only posts from followed users
- Ordered by newest first
- Paginated (10 posts per page)
- Empty feed when not following anyone
- Real-time updates (new posts appear)
- Authentication required

### ✅ Permissions:
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only modify their own following list
- Read-only access to other users' posts
- Proper 401/403/404 error responses

### ✅ Data Integrity:
- Safe user lookups (404 if not found)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Following list updates correctly
- Feed queries optimized with `filter()`

## Code Quality

- Maintained beginner-friendly style
- Clear comments explaining logic
- Simple, straightforward implementations
- DRF best practices followed
- Proper use of generic views
- Clean URL structure
- Reusable components

## Testing Performed

### Test Scenarios Covered:

✅ **Follow Operations:**
- Successfully follow a user
- Cannot follow yourself (error returned)
- Successfully unfollow a user
- Follow non-existent user (404)
- Follow without authentication (401)

✅ **Feed Operations:**
- Empty feed when not following anyone
- Feed shows posts from followed users
- Feed doesn't show posts from unfollowed users
- Feed ordered correctly (newest first)
- Pagination works correctly
- Feed without authentication (401)

✅ **Integration Tests:**
- Multiple users following each other
- Complex scenarios with 3+ users
- Posts appearing/disappearing based on follows
- Feed updates after follow/unfollow

## API Endpoints Summary

### Follow/Unfollow:
```
POST /api/follow/2/          - Follow user with ID 2
POST /api/unfollow/2/        - Unfollow user with ID 2
```

### Feed:
```
GET /api/feed/               - Get personalized feed
GET /api/feed/?page=2        - Get page 2 of feed
```

## Technical Implementation Details

**Follow Logic:**
```python
# Follow
request.user.following.add(user_to_follow)

# Unfollow
request.user.following.remove(user_to_unfollow)
```

**Feed Query:**
```python
following_users = request.user.following.all()
posts = Post.objects.filter(author__in=following_users).order_by('-created_at')
```

**Permission Check:**
```python
permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
```

## Files Modified/Created

## Migrations

No new migrations needed - the CustomUser model already had the followers field configured correctly.

## Next Steps (if needed)

Potential enhancements for future tasks:
- Add endpoint to list followers
- Add endpoint to list following
- Add follow suggestions
- Add mutual follows detection
- Add follow notifications
- Add follow counts to user profiles
- Add block/unblock functionality
