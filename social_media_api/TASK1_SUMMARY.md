- Both models use proper relationships (ForeignKey)
- Ordering configured (newest posts first, oldest comments first)

**Serializers** (`posts/serializers.py`):
- `PostSerializer` - handles post data with author details
- `CommentSerializer` - handles comment data with post and author info
- Read-only fields for timestamps and author info

**Views** (`posts/views.py`):
- `PostViewSet` - full CRUD operations for posts
- `CommentViewSet` - full CRUD operations for comments
- `IsAuthorOrReadOnly` - custom permission class
- `PostPagination` - 10 posts per page
- Search filtering by title and content
- Auto-assignment of author on creation

**URLs** (`posts/urls.py`):
- RESTful routing using DRF routers
- `/api/posts/` - all post endpoints
